# BlueToothDemo
Bluetooth manager application

This is a basic bluetooth manager with the added message passing
functionality. This application allows the user to enable/disable
bluetooth, discoverability, and listening mode. It also allows 
the user to list all paired devices and also shows connection status.
You can also scan for local devices using the scan button and and send
messages to connected devices.
